\section{Optimising diffusion parameters}

To optimise the diffusion parameters, the ABC algorithm was run for the
Buckfastleigh site with all detectors and with the roost set at the actual roost
location. For the diffusion coefficient $D$ a normal prior was used with $\mu =
75.5 m^2s^{-1}$ (calculated from radio tracking data) and $\sigma = \mu/4$. For
the emergence time $T_{emergence}$ a uniform prior was used with $0 \leq
T_{emergence} \leq 60$ minutes. For the length of diffusive period
$T_{diffusion}$, a uniform prior was used with $ 15 \leq T_{diffusion} \leq 120$
minutes. 


Insert graphs of priors and posteriors here:


$D$ and $T_diffusion$ linked.

Try plotting a graph of the prior/posterior for roost locations and then also
draw a polygon around the posterior or make a contour plot
